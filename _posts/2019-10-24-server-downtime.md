After some server-maintenance last evening, our Oslo-server is currently down.
There are both issues with SSL and with routing, and both are being worked on.

While the issues are being resolved, clients are advised to use falkenberg.se.eu.neko-net.org
instead.

This post will be updated once all servers are back up.

Sorry about the inconvenience.

**Update:** Oslo is back up, but irc-services are still offline.

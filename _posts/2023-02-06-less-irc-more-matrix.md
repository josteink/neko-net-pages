After years and years and years as an IRC network, we've today lost our Swedish
presence, after an unfortunate VPS-nuking mishap. It can happen to the best of
us.

That sort of puts this once profilitic IRC-network, with a global presence down
to one measly server. I guess it's a mono-network now, eh?

To be fair, even us old irc-diehards realize irc is getting kind of passe.
It's time to move on, but to what?

What's the spiritual successor to good old IRC? Based on online presence,
it doesn't seem to be [IRCv3](https://ircv3.net/). [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)
however is looking really nice:

* open protocol
* use any client you like
* host your own server

While decentralized like IRC, it [federates]() instead of relying on a coalition
of servers to form a "network", which kind of obliterates our the "need" for a
lots of neko-net servers in the first place.

So all in all, that's a win win!

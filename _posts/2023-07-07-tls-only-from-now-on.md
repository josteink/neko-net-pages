As someone who feels the nostalgia dripping down my cheek whenever I
see someone telnet into a service in plain-text and manually invoking
commands...

It fills my heart with tears to say that from now on Neko-net wont
support unencrypted plain-text connections anymore.

This is one of several responses to ongoing SPAM-attacks, and we hope
things will quiet down after this.

TLDR: The ports are all still there, but from now on ALL ports are TLS ports.

After years and years on Unreal IRCd 4.x, it's time to move on to Unreal 5.x.
Especially considering 4.x is now unsupported.

However upgarding to Unreal 5.x requires us to also upgrade services, and
Revie discovered that anope-services are no longer effectively maintained.

As a result, to facilitate the 5.x upgrade we are also moving to a new
services backend, athema.

This also means all registered nicks, channels, etc has been reset.

For all users still active, we realise setting things up once again is a
bit of a chore, but oh well. We did our part. Now you do yours!

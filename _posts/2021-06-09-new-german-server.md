We're pleased to announce a new server in the pool: dusseldorf.de.eu.neko-net.org.

This server supports all the "standard" ports, and if all goes well will be added
to the DNS round-robin in not too long.

In the meantime, for users accessing the network via IRC (as opposed to matrix),
feel free to check out this new server and help us test it.
